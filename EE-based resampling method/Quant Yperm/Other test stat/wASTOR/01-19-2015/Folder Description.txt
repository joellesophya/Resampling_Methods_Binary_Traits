EE method
logistic generating model
common variants used in assoc. test

Compare p-values from EE resampling method to those from ASTOR test stat.

Sims with 10K perm are the same settings & give comparable results as expected
Sim with 15K and higher poly. add. var. gives deflated type 1 error 
	--> indicates the poly. add. var. estimate is inflated
	--> could compare the estimated poly. add. var. to the population one 
	--> could be because only generating 15K perm-based replicates
