100 Y realizations
Ascertained Y based on 6-8 cases/family
EE-based resampling method
Test stat: GLS-VT

** log - theta0 = no poly. radom eff.
	--> Deflated type 1 error 
	
** liab - tu0 te20 = no poly. radom eff. & measurement err. var. set to 20
	--> Inflated type 1 error

==> Could be due to asc. present BUT not clear why one link function gives inflated type 1 err while the other leads to deflated type 1 erre
	~> Expect inflated type 1 error when ascertainment is not adjusted for in resampled Y's
	~> So results suggest there is some bug in the function used

==> In the absence of ascertainment, this approach should give correct type 1 error as there are only covariates present in the liability
