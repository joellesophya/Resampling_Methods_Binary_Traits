100 Y realizations
No ascertainment
No poly. additive effect
EE-based resampling method
logistic generating model
100 sets of 50 RVs
Test stat: GLS-VT

--> Obtained very deflated type 1 error (and histogram of p-values doesn't appear very close to uniform on right tail)
	==> suggests a bug in the code as the method should work when no ascertainment+poly. add. var. are present
	==> could also have been because low number of Y realizations but then the estimated type 1 error should be fairly close to nominal level (even if it's still considered as significantly different)
