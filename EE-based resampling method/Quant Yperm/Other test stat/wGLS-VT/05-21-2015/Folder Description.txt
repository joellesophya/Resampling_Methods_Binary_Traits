** theta0 : simulation bug = polygenic random effects were simulated although add_var = 0 (led to non p.s.d. matrix for Cov(u))
** theta50 : add_var was set to 1 (?? Not sure how that corresponds to .5 = add_var / (add_var + var(Xb))

--> Well-controlled type 1 error although the histogram of the p-values does not look uniform.
--> Similarily with the p-values QQ-plot where there is fairly strong deviation from uniform on the left tail (ie corresponding to large p-values)
