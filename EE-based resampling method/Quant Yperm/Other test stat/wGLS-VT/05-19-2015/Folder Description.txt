Binary Y but quantitave Y_perm
Ascertained based on 6-8 cases/family but no ascertainment on Yperm
100 RV sets w/ 50 markers/set
Test stat = One-sided GLS-VT
EE re-sampling method
logistic generating model

Obtain p-values from EE resampling method and assess type 1 err.

--> All simulations gave very inflated type 1 error 
	==> Not ascertaining the resampled Y's
		(1) Because the observed Y's are being ascertained, that increases the correlation between them
		(2) By not ascertaining the Y's obtained from re-sampling, they will not mimic as much of the correlation structure as that observed in original phenotype
		== These resampled Y's will have lower correlation
		(3) This will lead to inflated type 1 error
