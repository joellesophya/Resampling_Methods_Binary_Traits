Scenario 6 theta20: Var(pi) = 5% Var(Y), Prevalence at 32%
Scenario 6 theta40: Var(pi) = 7% Var(Y), Prevalence at 32%
Scenario 6 theta60: Var(pi) = 22% Var(Y), Prevalence at 35%

Scenario 6 h20: Var(pi) = 1% Var(Y), Prevalence at 32%
Scenario 6 h40: Var(pi) = 3% Var(Y), Prevalence at 32%
Scenario 6 h60: Var(pi) = 6% Var(Y), Prevalence at 32%



%% Note %% theta40 and h60 are about the same but type 1 error is inflated in h60 whereas it is deflated in theta40	
			--> Points to: Not enough Y replicates so the results are just due to sampling variability
						   Error in the code
