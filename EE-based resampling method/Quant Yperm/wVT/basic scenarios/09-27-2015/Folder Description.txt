150 Y realizations
Binary Y but binary Y_perm based on whole sample
Ascertainment based on 6-8 cases/family
150 RV sets w/ 50 markers/set
Test stat = VT
EE re-sampling method

** Scenario 2: sigma_a^2 = 0 and assume xi=0 in CARAT (ie logistic regression)
	~> Pop. prevalence = 33%, Var(p)/Var(Y) = 18%, Tu = 0, Tot= 0.96
	--> Type 1 error is strongly deflated 
		~> No random effect so all the variation in generation step comes from Bernouilli error so w/o asc most families would have about 7 affected
			= By adding ascertainment, we are making #aff in each family more variable
			!> But for Y replicates, since we are using xi=0, they will only deviate by their mean because of Bernouilli error so they will be less variable in the #aff compared to Y
				==> Correlation is stronger in Yrep 
				==> Will lead to deflated type 1 error
			!!> This conclusion only applies when sigma_a^2 = xi = 0 so Y is less variable (-- only due to Bernouilli error)
			
** Scenario 4: sigma_a^2 = 0 (covariates present)
	~> Pop. prevalence = 33%, Var(p)/Var(Y) = 18%, Tu = 0, Tot= 0.96
	--> Type 1 error is deflated
			= same results as those obtained in parametric bootstrap with 6-8 ascertainment
