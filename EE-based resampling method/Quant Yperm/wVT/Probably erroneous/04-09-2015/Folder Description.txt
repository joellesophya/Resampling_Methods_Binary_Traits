Binary Y but quantitave Y_perm
Ascertained based on 6-8 cases/family but no ascertainment on Yperm
100 RV sets w/ 50 markers/set
Test stat = VT
EE re-sampling method
logistic generating model

Obtain p-values from EE resampling method and assess type 1 err.

--> All simulations gave very inflated type 1 error 
	==> the shape of the histogram suggests that there is an error in the code
--> To ascertain with conversion of Yperm to binary, could threshold based on predicted pi and the topmost Y_bar pis are converted to 1s
