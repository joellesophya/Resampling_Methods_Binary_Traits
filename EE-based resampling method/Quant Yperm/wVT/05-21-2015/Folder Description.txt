Binary Y but quantitave Y_perm
Ascertained based on 6-8 cases/family but no ascertainment on Yperm
100 RV sets w/ 50 markers/set
Test stat = VT
EE re-sampling method

** liab: sigma_a^2 = 1, sigma_e^2 = 25
	--> Correct type 1 error
		~> Not clear why that would be the case in the presence of ascertainment (need to determine whether it was weak ascertainment, i.e. what is the population prevalence used?)
			~~> Trait replicate is quantitative and Yperm is such that E(Yperm) = E(Y) so no need to do rejection sampling on Yperm...

** log theta.09: sigma_a^2 = .1
	~> Pop. prevalence = 34%, Var(p)/Var(Y) = 19%, Tu = .09, Tot= 1.07
	--> Type 1 error is strongly deflated 
		== suggest estimated variance is much higher than true one OR the Y replicates have much less correlation than that in Y
			-->
		==> Could be due to the low number of Y realizations used (100)
		==> Poly. add. var. is pretty low in this setting so the type 1 error should not so strongly deviate from nominal level
		==> Could also be a bug in the code
	
** log theta.5: sigma_a^2 = 1
	~> Pop. prevalence = 35%, Var(p)/Var(Y) = 27%, Tu = .5, Tot= 1.96
	--> Type 1 error is well-controlled
		~> Similar to liab. model, still not clear why that would be the case in the presence of (strong) ascertainment
	--> Because poly. add. var. is bigger here, it suggests that sim above with theta.09 needed more realizations OR error in the code??

==> We still note that the right tail of the p-value histogram still doesn't look uniform (it has a "peak" at 1)
